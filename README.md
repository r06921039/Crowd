# Crowd

We’ve all been there. Arriving at a park to find that there is no space, or going to an exhibition only to become lost in a sea of people. Don’t we all wish there was some tool that allows us to know how crowded some place is without needing to go there first?

Introducing Crowd - Real-time, accurate crowdedness data visualization for venues and spaces.
